##Description:##

Write a function that takes an integer in input and outputs a string with currency format.

Integer in currency format is expressed by a string of number where every three characters are separated by comma.

_Ex. 123456 -> "123,456"_

Input will always be an positive integer, so don't worry about type checking or negative/float values.
