# Simon Says Game
This is a modified challenge from one that was given in phase 2 of Dev Bootcamp. I love the game SIMON and I wanted the challenge to be a real working game, so this code adds onto the sinatra app to hold game data, while the javascript runs the game.


## Overview

For this challenge, your task is add jQuery to the provided Sinatra shell for "Simple Simon Says".


## Core
Demonstrate knowledge of jQuery Events , AJAX request and response using JSON and DOM manipulation with jQuery.

## Objectives
Modify the shell code to implement the following functionality:

1. Clicking on the 'Start Game' button submits an AJAX request to the '/colors' route
- return a **JSON** object the server with a random color and cell number
- change the background color of the cell number returned to the color - WITHOUT MODIFYING THE HTML

2. Run a Simon game

### You know you're done when:
* Your code produces a simon game
* Your code is well factored
* You can clearly explain each how your code meets each of the Learning Goals above
